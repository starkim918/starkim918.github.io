        <p>I developed this website myself, and it has been a long and hard labor of love (i.e. a complete pain in my butt). I’ve never worked with HTML or CSS, so there was a decent learning curve at first that I have since come to greatly appreciate. "The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph", right? This project has slowly become my favorite, as I enjoyed the creative freedom and personal touches. I hope you like it as much as I do, and please feel free to view the source code on Github <a href="https://github.com/starkim918/starkim918.github.io">here</a>!</p>

        <p><em>Spanish is Fun</em> was a 6-week summer project focused on creating a mobile application for a local Spanish school. Developed for both iOS and Android platforms, our team of three undergraduate students aimed to enhance the language learning experience through engaging exercises and interactive features. The app offered a variety of functionality, including flashcards, multiple-choice quizzes, and audio-visual aids for pronunciation practice. Our work prioritized aesthetics and user experience, investing significant effort into design elements such as splash screens, logos, and visual content. The emphasis on quality permeated every aspect of the project, resulting in a polished and user-friendly application! The code remains under contract, so unfortunately there is no access.

        <p><em>Clue</em> was an undergraduate project developed over using Java and the Agile development process. I collaborated with a partner to create a desktop version of the classic board game, Clue. Designed as a single-player game, we faced the additional challenge of integrating computer-generated player moves through complex algorithms, adding depth and realism to the gameplay. A demo video showcasing the gameplay can be found to the left. Unfortunately, I am unable to publicly share the code, as the school still uses this project for students. If you’d like to view it, I am happy to add you as a collaborator!</p>

        <p><em>Promoting Social Health for International Students: A Human-Centered Design Approach to Support In-Situ Social Training, Reflection, and Connection</em> was a research project I conducted with three other graduate students that focused on the unique challenges faced by international students on campus. Leveraging social and collaborative computing values and human-centered design techniques, we aimed to understand and address the unique social health needs of this group. Our methodology included questionnaires, interviews, and user testing sessions, which allowed us to uncover problems, specify design implications, generate potential solutions, and develop a prototype application guided by our interviewees.

        <p><em>Hey Siri, Who's Listening?</em> was a solo research project I completed for a graduate seminar on Privacy and Security in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This project focused on the Siri voice activation function found in Apple devices. Through comprehensive at-home testing, I aimed to identify the frequency of accidental activations and examine the privacy implications of such behavior. The research revealed suspicious inconsistencies in Siri's behavior, particularly when comparing device responses in active mode versus sleep mode. These findings highlight potential privacy concerns related to unintended activations and data collection practices.
