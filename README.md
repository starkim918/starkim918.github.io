I developed this website myself, and it has been a long and hard labor of love (i.e. a complete pain in my butt). Iâ€™ve never worked with HTML or CSS, so there was a decent learning curve at first that I have since come to greatly appreciate. "The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph", right? This project has slowly become my favorite, as I enjoyed the creative freedom and personal touches. I hope you like it as much as I do! Please feel free to contact me with any questions.
